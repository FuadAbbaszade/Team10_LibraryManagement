# Library Management System

This is a Java-based Library Management System developed as a final team project for **CSCI1202 - Summer 2025**.

## 📘 Project Overview
This system simulates the basic operations of a real-world library using a Command-Line Interface (CLI) and also includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with JavaFX. It allows users to manage books by adding, listing, searching, editing, deleting, and sorting entries through both CLI and GUI interfaces.
